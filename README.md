# angular_weather_app
Geolocation current time and weather application - written in Angular.js

## Setup

Because this project uses a private API key, you must register for a free key at https://openweathermap.org/price

Once you have your API key:

- Create a new typescript file in the root folder called ```api_key.ts```
- In *```api_key.ts```* add:
  - ```export let api_key = { your API key };```

## Run The Project

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
